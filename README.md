## Requirements
1. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), recommended GIMP version >= 2.10.  
2. GIMP's python module gimpfu.  

## Installation
Download and extract the `file-spr` folder to GIMP's `plug-ins` folder:  
	**Windows**: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`  
	**Linux**: `/home/<USERNAME>/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins`  
	**macOS**: `/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins`

*If you canâ€™t locate the `plug-ins` folder, open GIMP and go to Edit > Preferences > Folders > Plug-Ins and use one of the listed folders.*

## Usage
To import `.spr` file into GIMP, go to File > Open.

To export image as `.spr` file from GIMP, go to File > Export As then enter the file name with `*.spr` extension and click *Export*. 
In the dialog box that appears, you can configure the exported sprite.

In this version of the plugin, export of frame groups is supported only if you have previously imported a sprite containing frame groups and have not changed the color indexing mode. Otherwise, the layer groups will be merged.
